Google uses ML models to help regulate the temperature of its servers. They read sensor data to optimize when cooling can be applied. It has increased cooling efficiency by 40%.

Upon giving user access to data in GCS then you can actually share a link, so for example if you have a picture in storage clicking it will share it.
