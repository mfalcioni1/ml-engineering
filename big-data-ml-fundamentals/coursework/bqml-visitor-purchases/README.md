# Predicting Visitor Purchases with a Classification Model

### Task 1 - Explore eCommerce data

#### Conversion rate
```sql
#standardSQL
WITH visitors AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_visitors
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
),

purchasers AS(
SELECT
COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS total_purchasers
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
WHERE totals.transactions IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT
  total_visitors,
  total_purchasers,
  total_purchasers / total_visitors AS conversion_rate
FROM visitors, purchasers
```

#### Top products
```sql
SELECT
  p.v2ProductName,
  p.v2ProductCategory,
  SUM(p.productQuantity) AS units_sold,
  ROUND(SUM(p.localProductRevenue/1000000),2) AS revenue
FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
UNNEST(hits) AS h,
UNNEST(h.product) AS p
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### Order on repeat visit

```sql
WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid, # 741,721 unique visitors
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullvisitorid) AS total_visitors,
  will_buy_on_return_visit
FROM all_visitor_stats
GROUP BY will_buy_on_return_visit
```

### Task 2 - Select features and create your training dataset

Exploring the feature set.
```sql
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1)
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
ORDER BY time_on_site DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Task 3 - Create a BigQuery dataset to store models

Done through UI.

### Task 4 - Select a BigQuery ML model type and specify options

Creating the model on the two simple features.
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS

#standardSQL
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)
;
```

### Task 5 - Evaluate classification model performance

Exploring ROC
```sql
SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model,  (

SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630') # eval on 2 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)

));
```

### Task 6 - Improve model performance with feature engineering

Adding more features to the model.

+ How far the visitor got in the checkout process on their first visit
+ Where the visitor came from (traffic source: organic search, referring site etc.)
+ Device category (mobile, tablet, desktop)
+ Geographic information (country)

```sql 
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model_2`
OPTIONS
  (model_type='logistic_reg', labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']) AS

WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid,
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

# add in new features
SELECT * EXCEPT(unique_session_id) FROM (

  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,

      # labels
      will_buy_on_return_visit,

      MAX(CAST(h.eCommerceAction.action_type AS INT64)) AS latest_ecommerce_progress,

      # behavior on the site
      IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
      IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site,
      totals.pageviews,

      # where the visitor came from
      trafficSource.source,
      trafficSource.medium,
      channelGrouping,

      # mobile or desktop
      device.deviceCategory,

      # geographic
      IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country

  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
     UNNEST(hits) AS h

    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)

  WHERE 1=1
    # only predict for new visits
    AND totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430' # train 9 months

  GROUP BY
  unique_session_id,
  will_buy_on_return_visit,
  bounces,
  time_on_site,
  totals.pageviews,
  trafficSource.source,
  trafficSource.medium,
  channelGrouping,
  device.deviceCategory,
  country
);
```

Model evaluation once complete.
```sql 
#standardSQL
SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'not great'

FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model_2,  (

  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

# add in new features
SELECT * EXCEPT(unique_session_id) FROM (

  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,

      # labels
      will_buy_on_return_visit,

      MAX(CAST(h.eCommerceAction.action_type AS INT64)) AS latest_ecommerce_progress,

      # behavior on the site
      IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
      IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site,

    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)

  WHERE 1=1
    # only predict for new visits
    AND totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630' # eval 2 months

  GROUP BY
  unique_session_id,
  will_buy_on_return_visit,
  bounces,
  time_on_site,
  totals.pageviews,
  trafficSource.source,
  trafficSource.medium,
  channelGrouping,
  device.deviceCategory,
  country
)
));
```

### Task 7 - Predict which new visitors will come back and purchase

Predict probability first-time visitors will come back to make a purchase.
```sql
SELECT

  ml.PREDICT(MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model_2`,
   (

SELECT
  fullvisitorid,
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, '-',CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,

      # labels
